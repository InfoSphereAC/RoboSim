	 * @abstract Calculates the first cell hit when following a line.
	 * @discussion This method follows the ray and reports the very first cell
	 * hit. It is aware of wall/no wall states and will report the correct
	 * solution for any ray in any direction. Notice that it is possible that
	 * no cell at all is hit.
	 * @param start The start of the ray.
	 * @param direction The direction of the ray.
	 * @param x On exit, the x-index of the cell, or undefined if no cell was
	 * hit.
	 * @param y On exit, the y-index of the cell, or undefined if no cell was
	 * hit.
	 * @param length The distance from start 
	 * @result true if a cell was hit, with indices of the cell
	 * in x and z and the distance in length, or false and the three outputs
	 * undefined otherwise.
